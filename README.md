# Serial-Binary-to-ASCII
Records up to 8 binary bits and decodes the byte to it's equivalent ASCII value. Must be running a serial terminal (like arduino serial console). Initial plan was to use arduino as a keyboard, but can only be done by flashing a new firmware on the atmel chip, which could potentially corrupt the bootloader and leave me with an expensive paperweight.
